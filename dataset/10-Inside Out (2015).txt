Title=Inside Out (2015)
Description=Growing up can be a bumpy road, and it&#39;s no exception for Riley, who is uprooted from her Midwest life when her father starts a new job in San Francisco. Like all of us, Riley is guided by her emotions - Joy, Fear, Anger, Disgust and Sadness. The emotions live in Headquarters, the control center inside Riley&#39;s mind, where they help advise her through everyday life. As Riley and her emotions struggle to adjust to a new life in San Francisco, turmoil ensues in Headquarters. Although Joy, Riley&#39;s main and most important emotion, tries to keep things positive, the emotions conflict on how best to navigate a new city, house and school.
